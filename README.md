# A simple regression model 

PartA:
It demonstrates a simple baseline regression model created using Keras.
Training and testing data are 70/30 split.
Used Relu activaiton function, and MSE to observe error.
The process is repeated 50 times.

PartB:
Same as PartA, but the data is normalized.
Both testing and traing data is normalized yielding different MSE.

PartC:
The number of epochs are increased to 100.
The rest of the test is same as in PartB.

PartD:
The number of hiddel layer increased to 3 with each having 10 nodes and ReLu activation function.
